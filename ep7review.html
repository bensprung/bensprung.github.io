Gordan, today. As I understand the thesis of the book from the review, there were five big honking important technological developments that "powered economic growth from 1870 to 1970: electricity, urban sanitation, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, the internal combustion engine and modern communication." All the big inventions (note you can add airplanes to the mix), at least broadly speaking, happened well before the 1920s, and the subsequent 50 years of rapid growth resulted from the realization of their potential. Technological change since then has been pretty meh since then (so the thesis goes), which is why (except for some of the 90s) we haven't had a sustained run of fast growth since the 60s.</p><p>Clearly this sort of thinking is in the "we wanted flying cars and we got 140 characters" vein. I think the point that the pace of change from 1870 to 1920 was far greater than the pace of change from 1920 to 1970 for first world countries is a good one. There may be some inescapable realities here, such as there only being one thing quite like electricity to invent. I also think the thesis is difficult to evaluate the closer to the present one looks; but leaving aside a discussion of relatively recent inventions like the transistor and the internet, and the argument that's it's probably difficult to contemporaneously identify innovations that may later prove to be transformative, I want to focus on the implicit statistical argument going on here. </p><p>Let us grant two premises: there were five transformative inventions in fifty years, and then zero transformative inventions in the next fifty years. Suppose this implies that the natural rate of transformative inventions, at the present state of human development, is the average over one hundred years, or one every twenty years. We can model this by a statistical object called a Poisson process, which is a way to say, in our case, "events happen randomly but happen on average at a certain rate". A good example of a Poisson process would be births in a city. If, say, the average for the city is ten births per hour, and you wanted to know the odds that in the next hour there would be at least 12 births, the mathematical model of a Poisson process could tell you. Note that in each birth is totally independent of another birth, a hallmark of a Poisson process.</p><p>OK so our rate of transformative inventions is one per 20 years. What are the odds of <b>not</b> seeing a transformative invention over a 50-year time period? TNote that we expect 2.5 inventions over 50 years. Then the odds of 0 inventions in 50 years are <i>e</i>^-2.5 which is about 8%. In other words, an 8% chance that we are still in the one-every-20-year regime, but we happened to get unlucky for 50 years. That chance isn't high, but it's not infinitesimal by any means. If you grant that there was one transformative invention from 1920 to 1970 (the transistor perhaps?) then the odds that the 50 lean years was due to chance goes up to 20%. </p><p>This analysis is a little glib but I think the point still stands. Think of the rate of transformative inventions as something like  humanity's batting average. Gordon points out that we've hit a big slump. The question is, is it <b>just</b> a slump in the sense of a run of bad luck, or are we like an over-the-hill batter whose skills have irrevocably declined and will never bounce back? This little analysis suggests that there isn't really any way to know, but I have a gut sense that our future jet-pack-wearing, virtual-reality-surfing, on-Saturn-vacationing, self-genome-editing descendants (or "descendants" if that particular one comes to pass) will think this is a funny question.</p><p>tags: economics; statistics; futurism</p></div><div id=spacer></div><h2 id = "seth-curry-with-the-shot"> <a class="reversible" data-div="seth-curry-with-the-shot_text" href="seth-curry-with-the-shot.html">Do as I do, not as I say, Steph Curry edition</a></h2><h3>2016-01-09</h3><div id="seth-curry-with-the-shot_text" class="blog_entries" style="display:none;"><p></p><p>This video from YouTube user "Splash Lab" that breaks Steph Curry's shooting form is excellent.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_anxl_hE9jQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Later in my internet quest to shoot like Steph Curry, I came across an <a href ="http://www.forbes.com/sites/hunteratkins/2014/08/26/shooting-tips-from-n-b-a-all-star-stephen-curry-2/#78a72be6309a">article</a> in which a reporter hits the gym with Curry to get shooting tips straight from the <strike>horse's</strike> greatest shooter who's ever lived's mouth.</p><p>What is super fascinating to me is that every single concrete instruction about shooting that Curry gives the guy, Curry himself doesn't really follow, as I will illustrate with stills from the aforementioned video. Curry suggests to:</p><p>1. Point feet at the basket</p><p>> “That means I’ve got 10 toes facing the basket,” Curry simply puts it.</p><p>Yet Curry angles his feet well to the left of the basket:</p><p><img src="media/curry_feet.png"/></p><p>2. Make a 90 degree angle at the elbow</p><p>Here's a nice pic from the article of Curry instructing the reporters on the importance of the right angle (photo credit: Jason DeCrow/AP Images):</p><p><img src="media/curry_instructs.jpg"/></p><p>Yet Curry's elbow angle is well under 90 degrees when he is shooting:</p><p><img src="media/curry_elbow.png"/></p><p>3. Hold the ball in the fingertips, creating space between ball and palm.</p><p>> “You don’t have to exaggerate it, just enough where you can have a little bit of daylight in there and see,” he says, literally peering from behind his hand to make sure light shines through.</p><p>The Splash Labs video makes a point of labeling Curry a "palm shooter", one who does not have space between palm and ball for most of the shooting motion.</p><p><img src="media/curry_palm.png"/></p><p>I think this is illustrative of what is probably a common phenomenon, and is why the best coaches in any sport often aren't the best players, but the best observers of the game. Even great players don't necessarily know the details of what they do. Or course, why should they? After all, they can't see themselves as they perform, and they're so good they don't need to intently examine what others do. I'm sure the things Curry mentioned are useful to him in some way, perhaps as cues. For instance, maybe "arm at 90 degrees" is a useful cue for "elbow up". But for emulating his form it's much better to watch him carefully than to listen to what he says.</p><p>tags: basketball; teaching</p></div><div id=spacer></div><h2 id = "ep7review"> <a class="reversible" data-div="ep7review_text" href="ep7review.html">Review of Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a></h2><h3>2016-01-07</h3><div id="ep7review_text" class="blog_entries" ><p>
<h3>A Not-So-New Hope</h3></p><p>A droid entrusted with secret information is marooned on a desert planet. A black-shrouded, masked figure directs merciless white-clad troopers with a machinelike voice. In a seedy bar, a pan-galactic swing band toots to a disreputable crowd. With these subtle and not-so-subtle callbacks to the original movies, JJ Abrams welcomes fans back to the Star Wars universe and reassures them that he’s not out to subject it to his personal whims. The movie begins with pace and verve, introducing a reluctant stormtrooper as a main character. By pulling back the veil on one of those previously present only as a faceless army, Abrams offers the promise of peeling back new layers on a galaxy far, far away. </p><p>Sadly this promise is unfulfilled. Instead, the callbacks to the originals, like a pleasant homecoming at first, but later like an overlong visit, continue to pile up. Old friends return, but more that than: old plot points too. It’s not giving too much away to say that essential advice is dispensed by a small, wizened creature; that there is a big round death machine that is to be blown up by buzzing starfighters after a shield is disabled; that the black-masked man’s allegiance is to a craggly-visaged hologram; and that a reveal of a family relationship is essential to the plot. Stop me if you’ve heard any of this before; if, like most piling into the theaters to this this movie, you have seen the originals, you have. </p><p>JJ Abrams is a more than capable director. The movie is well-paced, and obvious and distracting CGI is mercifully--and for any adult who’s had to sit through the first bunch of prequels, it is a true mercy--kept to a minimum. The new triumvirate of main characters to replace Luke, Leia, and Han, is commendably diverse. The movie ends with a deliberate cliffhanger, like the old Sunday serials that inspired George Lucas. While it’s hard not to see the commercial dictates of the Disney ownership at work in this device, let’s hope that Abrams, when he picks up where he left off, feels he has done enough to prove his fidelity to the universe Lucas created. Star Wars, when it first came out, was amazingly original, but (especially if you believe Joseph Campbell) at once familiar. Abrams has nailed the familiar part with ease. Let’s hope he has some originality in store. </p><p>tags: movie reviews</p></div><div id=spacer></div>
