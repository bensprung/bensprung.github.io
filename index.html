<p>Summary: <br>
* 5% of children in Flint have high BLLs 
* 3000 areas with high BLL rates at least 2x that of Flint
* "In some pockets of Baltimore, Cleveland, and Philadelphia, where lead poisoning has spanned generations, the rate of elevated tests over the last decade was 40 to 50 percent."
* 2.5% of all small children nationally have BLLs higher than 5 ug/dL, the CDC's standard for intervention, unreal. 4 million households. 
* Reuters got data by census tract (or zip code) by requesting such info from states. It's not general available--usually statewide or countywide data is disclosed. They have maps for especially bad places: Baltimore, Buffalo, Cleveland, Chose City, Fresno, LA, Milwaukee, South Bend, St. Joseph. 
* Reuters got data from 21 states and ~60% of population. 
* PA is the worst state: "In 49 different tracts, from inner city Philadelphia to capital Harrisburg, at least 40 percent of children tested had high lead."
* In many places there is very little funding for lead testing (let alone remediation)</p> <a class="read-more" href="reuters-article-about-lead-12-19-16/">»</a>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brooks was emblematic of the way the entire bipartisan centrist industry conducted itself throughout the Obama years. It was neither possible for Obama to co-opt the center, nor for Republicans to abandon it, because official centrists would simply relocate themselves to the midpoint of wherever the parties happened to stand....</p>
  
  <p>The centrists could have played a role in braking the growing extremism of the Republican party. It would have meant telling the country that there was now one moderate, governing party and one extremist faction, and parking themselves with the moderate party until such time as the dynamic changed. They could not do it. If there’s not much of a center left to stop Trump from trampling democratic norms, it is because the centrists abdicated their responsibility and destroyed themselves.</p>

        <p></p><p>Collecting some things I've read over the last couple of weeks.<!--preview--></p>

<h5 id="whyhrclostwhovotedforwho">Why HRC lost - who voted for who</h5>

<ul>
<li>First let's note that it's going to be a <a href="https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/797111100294696960">pretty big popular vote victory for HRC</a>. This election is probably pretty close to a worst-case popular vote/EC split. </li>
<li>The big story, as Nate Cohn puts it, is that "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/upshot/how-did-trump-win-over-so-many-obama-voters.html">millions of white working-class voters across the United States voted for Obama and then switched to Trump.</a>"
<ul><li>Of course, the "white working class" is over-broad. In the context of this election what's probably important is a particular subset in which Obama did well and HRC did not: "<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/revenge-of-the-forgotten-class">voters in northern states where unions, however diminished, still served to remind members of their Democratic roots (and build inter-racial solidarity).</a>"</li>
<li>I do wonder if it was literally the same people. It's anecdotal, but in the article linked above, many Trump voters interviewed are first-time, or first-time-in-a-long-time, voters. Perhaps a significant portion of Obama voters stayed home and were replaced. </li>
<li>The influence of this group was <em>surprising</em>, in addition to being crucial, in part because there are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/upshot/there-are-more-white-voters-than-people-think-thats-good-news-for-trump.html">more white voters than analysts thought</a>. That is, the 2012 exit polls told a story about the composition of the electorate that undercounted both the white working class's turnout <em>and</em> support for Obama. In other words, Obama didn't win because of demographic shifts (from which there's no going back), he just won. </li></ul></li>
<li>Trump didn't lose women to the degree one might have expected/hoped. Although the vote seems to be historically stratified by gender, white women, according to exit polls, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/clinton-couldnt-win-over-white-women/">as a whole broke for Trump.</a></li>
<li>Other turnout questions are still outstanding. For example it's not yet clear how Hipanics as a group voted--exit polls <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/here-s-how-get-latino-vote-right-exit-polls-n684826">conflict with eve-of-election polling</a>. </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="whyhrclostdeepercauses">Why HRC lost - deeper causes</h5>

<p>Just listing things worth reading here--don't necessarily agree with all. </p>

<ul>
<li>James Comey did it: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-james-comey.html">“We lost with college-educated whites after leading with them all summer,” a Clinton spokesman, Brian Fallon, said on Wednesday. “Five more days of reminders about Comey, and they gravitated back to Trump.”</a>
<ul><li>I note that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html">exit polls</a> at first glance support this story, but at second glance they may not. Trump won strongly among voters who reported deciding in October, and Comey's letter was released on October 28, so unless a lot of people made up their minds then and there and reported it as "in October", something else was going on in that group. 
<img src="content/images/2016/11/decided_vote_when.JPG" alt=""></li></ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-09/facebook-and-twitter-contend-with-their-role-in-trump-s-victory">Facebook</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook?utm_term=.gbb0Bw3pkv#.njml13nRPv">did</a> <a href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/11/donald-trump-won-because-of-facebook.html">it</a>. It's fashionable to hate on Facebook, but: it's looking like they deserve it. </li>
<li>HRC campaign's strategic decisions were not optimal. Mostly, going for a landslide by focusing TV resources on hammering at Trump's unfitness for office, rather than on HRC's strengths (which would fire up traditionally Dem voters), and ignoring upper Midwest states thought to be safe. Very very easy to play Monday morning quarterback though. <br>
<ul><li>Was the vaunted ground game <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/11/clinton-campaign-gotv-unions-voters-rust-belt/">not actually very good?</a>. (For the record I think that much of this particular article is sloppy, unfair, and/or wrong. Nevertheless, it's interesting that there were far fewer field offices than in 2012. My personal experience in South Philly was that it was a well-run operation contacting the right people with pretty good data.)</li></ul></li>
<li>Because the left has slowly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/books/richard-rortys-1998-book-suggested-election-2016-was-coming.html">abandoned economic justic in favor of identity politics</a> (No this link isn't to the Lilla op-ed. And I'm not sure what I think of this argument yet. What would it have looked like to <em>not</em> "abandon economic justice?" <a href="http://www.bradford-delong.com/2016/11/a-question-for-paul-krugman-please-sir-may-i-still-fly-my-neoliberal-freak-flag.html">[Germany?]</a> And was the left really incapable of focusing on both at once?)</li>
<li>Obama <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/opinion/sunday/obama-lobbies-against-obliteration-by-trump.html">lost touch and moved the machine for Hillary</a>
<ul><li>The role of party gatekeepers in the this election is interesting. On the GOP side, the gatekeepers were ineffective. On the Dem side, the gatekeepers were arguably effective but also arguably wrong in their choice. (For a sampling of the DNC-stole-it point of view, go read any Reddit thread about Bernie, e.g. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/5c384j/burlington_mayor_bernie_sanders_picks_up_trash_on/d9tc1ef/">this one</a>). </li></ul></li>
