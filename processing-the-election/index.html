<h5 id="whyhrclostwhovotedforwho">Why HRC lost - who voted for who</h5>

<ul>
<li>First let's note that it's going to be a <a href="https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/797111100294696960">pretty big popular vote victory for HRC</a>. This election is probably pretty close to a worst-case popular vote/EC split. </li>
<li>The big story, as Nate Cohn puts it, is that "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/upshot/how-did-trump-win-over-so-many-obama-voters.html">millions of white working-class voters across the United States voted for Obama and then switched to Trump.</a>"
<ul><li>Of course, the "white working class" is over-broad. In the context of this election we really mean a particular subset in which Obama did well: "<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/revenge-of-the-forgotten-class">voters in northern states where unions, however diminished, still served to remind members of their Democratic roots (and build inter-racial solidarity).</a>"</li>
<li>I do wonder if it was literally the same people. It's anecdotal, but in the article linked above, many Trump voters interviewed are first-time, or first-time-in-a-long-time, voters. Perhaps some Obama voters stayed home and were replaced. </li>
<li>This group was so <em>surprisingly</em> influential in part because there are just <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/upshot/there-are-more-white-voters-than-people-think-thats-good-news-for-trump.html">more white voters than we thought</a>, i.e. based on sources of data that are more reliable than the 2012 exit polls, and they voted for Obama in larger numbers than previously thought. In other words, Obama didn't win because of demographic shifts, he just won. </li></ul></li>
<li>Trump didn't lose women to the degree one might have expected. Although the vote seems to be historically stratified by gender, white women, according to exit polls, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/clinton-couldnt-win-over-white-women/">as a whole broke for Trump.</a></li>
<li>Other turnout questions are still outstanding. For example it's not yet clear how Hipanics as a group voted--exit polls <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/here-s-how-get-latino-vote-right-exit-polls-n684826">conflict with eve-of-election polling</a></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="whyhrclostdeepercauses">Why HRC lost - deeper causes</h5>

<ul>
<li>Comey: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-james-comey.html">“We lost with college-educated whites after leading with them all summer,” a Clinton spokesman, Brian Fallon, said on Wednesday. “Five more days of reminders about Comey, and they gravitated back to Trump.”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-09/facebook-and-twitter-contend-with-their-role-in-trump-s-victory">It</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook?utm_term=.gbb0Bw3pkv#.njml13nRPv">was</a> <a href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/11/donald-trump-won-because-of-facebook.html">Facebook</a></li>
<li>HRC campaign's strategic decisions: mostly, going for a landslide by focusing TV resources on hammering at Trump's unfitness for office, rather than on HRC's strengths, and ignoring upper Midwest state thought to be safe. Easy to play armchair quarterback though. <br>
<ul><li>Was the vaunted ground game <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/11/clinton-campaign-gotv-unions-voters-rust-belt/">not actually very good?</a>. (For the record I think that much of this particular article is sloppy, unfair, and/or wrong. Nevertheless, it's interesting that there were far fewer field offices than in 2012. My personal experience in South Philly was that it was a well-run operation contacting the right people with pretty good data.)</li></ul></li>
<li>Because the left has slowly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/books/richard-rortys-1998-book-suggested-election-2016-was-coming.html">abandoned economic justic in favor of identity politics</a> (No this link isn't to the Lilla op-ed).
<ul><li>Two personal thoughts. (1) Liberalism does not do well with rage. (2) I forget. </li></ul></li>
<li>Because Obama <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/opinion/sunday/obama-lobbies-against-obliteration-by-trump.html">lost touch and moved the machine for Hillary</a></li>
