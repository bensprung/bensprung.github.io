<blockquote>
  <p>Convinced that their wallets if not their lives were in danger, and convinced that the government was powerless, landowners turned to Fascism. Fascism could do what agrarians could never do. It could launch an anti-Socialist crusade. The reason was simple. Whereas agrarians had an extremely rigid domestic program, Fascists had close to none. <strong>They had jettisoned so much of their ideology that only a generic hatred of liberal government and socialism remained.</strong> [Emphasis mine]</p>
