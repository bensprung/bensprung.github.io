Curry suggests to:</p><p>1. Point feet at the basket</p><p>> “That means I’ve got 10 toes facing the basket,” Curry simply puts it.</p><p>Yet Curry angles his feet well to the left of the basket:</p><p><img src="media/curryfeet.png"/></p><p>2. Make a 90 degree angle at the elbow</p><p>Here's a nice pic from the article of Curry instructing the reporters on the importance of the right angle (photo credit: Jason DeCrow/AP Images):</p><p><img src="media/curryinstructs.jpg"/></p><p>Yet Curry's elbow angle is well under 90 degrees when he is shooting:</p><p><img src="media/curryelbow.png"/></p><p>3. Hold the ball in the fingertips, creating space between ball and palm.</p><p>> “You don’t have to exaggerate it, just enough where you can have a little bit of daylight in there and see,” he says, literally peering from behind his hand to make sure light shines through.</p><p>The Splash Labs video makes a point of labeling Curry a "palm shooter", one who does not have space between palm and ball for most of the shooting motion.</p><p><img src="media/currypalm.png"/></p><p>I think this is illustrative of what is probably a common phenomenon, and is why the best coaches in any sport often aren't the best players, but the best observers of the game. Even great players don't necessarily know the details of what they do. Or course, why should they? After all, they can't see themselves as they perform, and they're so good they don't need to intently examine what others do. I'm sure the things Curry mentioned are useful to him in some way, perhaps as cues. For instance, maybe "arm at 90 degrees" is a useful cue for "elbow up". But for emulating his form it's much better to watch him carefully than to listen to what he says.</p><p>tags: basketball; teaching</p></div><h2 id = "ep7review"> <a class="reversible" data-div="ep7review_text" href="ep7review.html">Review of Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a></h2><h3>2016-01-07</h3><div id="ep7review_text" class="blog_entries" style="display:none;"><p>
<h3>A Not-So-New Hope</h3></p><p>A droid entrusted with secret information is marooned on a desert planet. A black-shrouded, masked figure directs merciless white-clad troopers with a machinelike voice. In a seedy bar, a pan-galactic swing band toots to a disreputable crowd. With these subtle and not-so-subtle callbacks to the original movies, JJ Abrams welcomes fans back to the Star Wars universe and reassures them that he’s not out to subject it to his personal whims. The movie begins with pace and verve, introducing a reluctant stormtrooper as a main character. By pulling back the veil on one of those previously present only as a faceless army, Abrams offers the promise of peeling back new layers on a galaxy far, far away. </p><p>Sadly this promise is unfulfilled. Instead, the callbacks to the originals, like a pleasant homecoming at first, but later like an overlong visit, continue to pile up. Old friends return, but more that than: old plot points too. It’s not giving too much away to say that essential advice is dispensed by a small, wizened creature; that there is a big round death machine that is to be blown up by buzzing starfighters after a shield is disabled; that the black-masked man’s allegiance is to a craggly-visaged hologram; and that a reveal of a family relationship is essential to the plot. Stop me if you’ve heard any of this before; if, like most piling into the theaters to this this movie, you have seen the originals, you have. </p><p>JJ Abrams is a more than capable director. The movie is well-paced, and obvious and distracting CGI is mercifully--and for any adult who’s had to sit through the first bunch of prequels, it is a true mercy--kept to a minimum. The new triumvirate of main characters to replace Luke, Leia, and Han, is commendably diverse. The movie ends with a deliberate cliffhanger, like the old Sunday serials that inspired George Lucas. While it’s hard not to see the commercial dictates of the Disney ownership at work in this device, let’s hope that Abrams, when he picks up where he left off, feels he has done enough to prove his fidelity to the universe Lucas created. Star Wars, when it first came out, was amazingly original, but (especially if you believe Joseph Campbell) at once familiar. Abrams has nailed the familiar part with ease. Let’s hope he has some originality in store. </p><p>tags: movie reviews</p></div>
